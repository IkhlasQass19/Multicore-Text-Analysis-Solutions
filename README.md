# Multicore Text Analysis Solutions

## Introduction

The massive processing of data has become a significant challenge in computing, especially with the rise of multiprocessor architectures. This repository addresses the issue of analyzing large text files to count word occurrences, a seemingly simple task complicated by the sheer volume of data and the diversity of architectures involved.

## Objectives

Our primary objective is to propose effective solutions for this task using different architectures:

1. Multicore architecture with the OpenMP environment.
2. PC cluster with the MPI library.
3. PC cluster with the MapReduce approach of Hadoop using Hadoop streaming.

## Approach

### Context and Challenges
We'll begin by describing the context and challenges associated with massive data processing.

### Architecture Specifics
Detailed insights into the specifics of each architecture will be provided, emphasizing their advantages and limitations for this type of processing.

### Implementations
We'll delve into the implementations for each architecture, offering clear explanations and annotated code examples for each significant step of the word occurrence counting process in text files.

## Usage

Each architecture's implementation can be found in its respective directory:

- `multicore_openmp`: Implementation for the multicore architecture with the OpenMP environment.
- `pc_cluster_mpi`: Implementation for the PC cluster with the MPI library.
- `pc_cluster_mapreduce`: Implementation for the PC cluster with the MapReduce approach of Hadoop using Hadoop streaming.

Refer to the README file in each directory for specific usage instructions.
